Update
==================

Before each update please read carefully the information about **compatibility issues** between your version and the latest one in [changelog](/changelog/).

* Delete all the files in the installation folder **except App_Data and web.config**.
    * Default location is `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\Bonobo.Git.Server`.
    * Review changes in the new web.config and merge them to the old one.
* Copy the files from the downloaded archive to the server location.
* Review the [migration notes](/migration-notes/).
